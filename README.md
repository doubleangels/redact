# Redact

Redact is a simple, powerful privacy-focused app that removes hidden metadata (EXIF data) from your photos and videos before sharing them online. This helps protect your privacy by eliminating personal information that could be exposed when sharing content on social media and other platforms.

**Take control of your digital footprint and share content on your terms!**

## How It Works

Redact helps you protect your privacy in two simple ways:

1. **Gallery Selection:**

   - Open Redact
   - Select multiple photos and videos
   - Tap once to remove EXIF data from all selected files
   - Share your cleaned files without privacy concerns

2. **Share Integration:**
   - When viewing a photo or video in any app
   - Use the share function

## FAQ

### What exactly is EXIF data?

EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) data is hidden metadata embedded in photos and videos that can include:

- GPS location coordinates
- Date, time, and timezone information
- Device manufacturer and model
- Camera settings (aperture, shutter speed, etc.)
- Sometimes even unique identifiers

### Does Redact alter the quality of my photos or videos?

No. Redact is designed to preserve the original quality of your media files while removing only the metadata.

### Does Redact need internet access?

No. The core functionality works completely offline. Your files never leave your device.

### Where are processed files stored?

Cleaned files are saved to your device's storage in a designated folder for easy access.

### Are there any analytics or trackers?

This app uses [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) and only collects anonymized data to help diagnose issues. The information I receive includes:

- **Device model and type**
- **Operating system version**
- **App version**
- **Battery life, memory usage, and storage status when an error occurs**
- **Connection type (Wi-Fi/cellular) and VPN status at the time of an error** (No IP addresses are collected or logged)
- **Detailed crash reports and error logs**
- **Performance metrics for specific code sections**
