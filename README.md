## FAQ

### <a id="what-is-exif-data"></a>What exactly is EXIF data?

EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) data is hidden metadata embedded in photos and videos that can include:

- GPS location coordinates
- Date, time, and timezone information
- Device manufacturer and model
- Camera settings (aperture, shutter speed, etc.)
- Sometimes even unique identifiers

### <a id="quality-preservation"></a>Does Redact alter the quality of my photos or videos?

No. Redact is designed to preserve the original quality of your media files while removing only the metadata.

### <a id="internet-access"></a>Does Redact need internet access?

No. The core functionality works completely offline. Your files never leave your device.

### <a id="file-storage"></a>Where are processed files stored?

Cleaned files are saved to your device's storage in a designated folder for easy access.

### <a id="analytics-tracking"></a>Are there any analytics or trackers?

This app uses [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) and only collects anonymized data to help diagnose issues. The information I receive includes:

- **Device model and type**
- **Operating system version**
- **App version**
- **Battery life, memory usage, and storage status when an error occurs**
- **Connection type (Wi-Fi/cellular) and VPN status at the time of an error** (No IP addresses are collected or logged)
- **Detailed crash reports and error logs**
- **Performance metrics for specific code sections**
